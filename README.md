Weather Prediction Analysis Report
This project involves the analysis and prediction of weather data from the WeatherAUS dataset, with a focus on predicting whether it will rain the next day (RainTomorrow). The analysis includes data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and the development of a machine learning model using a neural network to make predictions.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning
* Data Overview: The dataset consists of various features, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and others, along with the target variable RainTomorrow.
* Missing Values: Missing values in categorical variables were handled by dropping rows with missing data, while missing values in numerical variables were filled with the median of each respective feature.
* Categorical Variables: The dataset contains several categorical variables such as Location, WindGustDir, and WindDir9am. These were encoded using LabelEncoder.
* Numerical Variables: Numerical variables like MinTemp, MaxTemp, and Rainfall were standardized using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
* Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix was generated to identify relationships between features. This helped in understanding the importance and interaction between different features.
2. Modeling
* Model Architecture: A Sequential model was built using Keras, consisting of the following layers:
  - Dense layers with ReLU activation
  - Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
  - A final Dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification
* Training: The model was trained with early stopping to avoid overfitting, with a validation split of 20%. The model's performance was tracked using the validation accuracy and loss.
3. Performance Evaluation
* Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix was plotted to visualize the performance of the model in terms of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.
* Classification Report: A detailed classification report was generated, showing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
* Accuracy: The final accuracy of the model on the test set was calculated to be {accuracy}, indicating how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
4. Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for developing a weather prediction model, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. The model's performance can be further improved by experimenting with different architectures, tuning hyperparameters, or using more sophisticated techniques like ensemble methods.

This analysis provides a solid foundation for understanding weather prediction and showcases the practical application of machine learning techniques to real-world data.
